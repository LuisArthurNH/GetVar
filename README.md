# GetVar

The file getvariables.py contains two packages: PSCADVar and OMEditVar. They get data from the output of both programs simulations and storage it in a object.

OMEditVar reads data from .mat or .csv files: just give the path as argument

PSCADVar reads data from .out: just give the .INF path as argument
